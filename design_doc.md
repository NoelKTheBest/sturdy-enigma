# Quick Design Doc

This design doc is for the comfy jam that we are working on. I will be putting here all the info to keep the scope manageable and I would like to not add too much to this doc or to the project in order to prevent feature creep. Although for right now, i don't think that it'll be much of an issue.

## World Interaction
Right now, we have the idea of navigating the world using platforming. Which I think sounds very interesting and removes the need for backtracking through previously seen areas. The way in which I'm planning this is to have a big area in the game in which the player can move through and interact with different items and people.
For an example: One of the main areas in the game could be a village of sorts and the player would need to jump up or down onto different platforms in order to reach certain areas in the village. Or it could be even simpler, just letting the player walk through different rooms until they reach the desired area. I think a hybrid approach would be most effective.

### Music Suggestions
For the music, we'd really only need 1 or 2 tracks for this part of the game. I also plan to have most of the game take place in this central area with people that you talk to. There is not much need for many more. I'm just listing what we will need. Anything extra is ofc welcome : >

I listed potentially 2 just for the sake of variety for the player. One place, I could see having a different vibe could be the player's home. Maybe it has a different tune or something. Again, not entirely necessary, just if we had the time, it could be an interesting detail. I want to hear from Risk about this before I make a whole bunch of suggestions that can't be executed on in time.
